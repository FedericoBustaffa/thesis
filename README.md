# PPGA

## Parallel Processing framework for Genetic Algorithms

The goal of `PPGA` project is to optimize genetic
algorithms through multithreading, multiprocessing and
pipelining.

The user is still in charge of defining the GA as he
prefer. The PPGA engine's job is mostly the optimizitation
of the initial population and the evaluation of the
population through generations.
